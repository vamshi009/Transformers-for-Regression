Product Description: Slate is a strength brand that makes high protein drinks that are better for you and better for our planet. Our protein drinks contain 20g protein, 1g sugar, 110 calories or less, are lactose free, keto friendly, and unbelievably delicious. Slate chocolate milks come in Classic Chocolate, Dark Chocolate, Mocha Latte, Vanilla Latte, Caramel Latte, and French Vanilla flavors. Our High Protein Iced Coffees are caffeinated with 175mg of caffeine and are commonly used as a coffee replacement. We’re able to control exactly which ingredients go into our products using a process called ultrafiltration. Ultrafiltered milk has had all of the lactose sugars filtered out. It also removes some water and allows us to create a more protein packed, lower sugar product. We also sell our all natural products in recyclable aluminum cans, that can be easily taken on the go as ready to drink protein shakes. You can drink a Slate anytime, but our customers like to use it as a breakfast meal replacement, protein coffee, post workout protein shake, healthy snack, or a healthy dessert. We use absolutely no artificial ingredients, and are gluten free, soy free, nut free, and Kosher Certified. Our high protein drinks are also shelf stable and can be stored at room temperature in your cabinet for months. But as most tasty refreshing beverages we recommend drinking them cold! Giving Chocolate Milk a Clean Slate - Manny Lubin and Josh Belinsky co-founded Slate with the goal of creating a healthy chocolate milk they could drink every day. After a successful Kickstarter campaign, an appearance on ABC's Shark Tank, and hundreds of iterations of testing, Slate launched in late 2019 with three delicious chocolate milk flavors. Today, Slate has expanded into new flavors and additional product lines, all of which contain 20g protein, have 1g sugar, are lactose free, and 100% plastic neutral.

Our probiotic remains viable under a wide temperature and pH range, via stability testing, the probiotics that we use experienced virtually no loss of colony-forming units (CFU) over 24 months when stored at room temperature (25°C).

Culture Pop is a probiotic soda made with organic fruit juices and real, ground organic spices & herbs.

Compared to other prebiotic soda, lemon lime soda, organic soda, strawberry soda, strawberry rhubarb, Culture Pop is made the way that you’d hope your soda would be made! Each flavor is crafted by steeping organic spices and/or herbs into an organic blend of real fruit juices! We then add billions of CFU’s of our live probiotic to each can. The result is a delicious, complex, slightly sweet soda - with only 45 calories per can. Each flavor is familiar - flavors you already know & love - but with a tasty twist. And, of course, we use no refined sweeteners, no stevia, and no other high-intensity or artificial sweeteners. Our low-sugar sodas are non-GMO, vegan, gluten-free, and plant-based. Culture Pop is not fermented, our probiotic does not impact the flavor of our sodas, and there is no vinegar-like aftertaste that sometimes is found with kombucha products. Unlike kombucha, Culture Pop is shelf-stable and can be stored at ambient temperatures.

323,234314,"Item Name: Gorilla Mind Protein Bars (Oatmeal Chocolate Chip) - 20g High-Performance Protein Bar/Incredible Taste And Texture/Emphasis On Whey Protein Isolate
Bullet Point 1: 20 GRAMS OF QUALITY PROTEIN: Packed with 20 grams of high-quality protein (emphasis on whey protein isolate), this bar will support performance and aid in recovery. This high-quality protein formulation is quickly assimilated, easy on the stomach, and doesn’t sacrifice on taste.
Bullet Point 2: EXTREMELY SATISFYING: Our 70-gram bar, a robust blend of macronutrients, serves as a potent, delicious, and filling meal replacement. Almost all low-calorie protein bars are less than satisfying and taste like synthetic ""diet"" food, and almost all higher-calorie protein bars taste like chemical-laden sugar bombs. Our bars taste like a dessert (without being sickeningly sweet with sugar), aren't overly calorie-dense, and will leave you satisfied.
Bullet Point 3: INCREDIBLE TASTE & TEXTURE: Beyond the performance benefits and easy digestion, our bar is delicious. Naturally flavored with protein crisps, real chocolate, and authentic nut butter, these bars taste incredible. We truly feel we’ve nailed the taste on this one. These ingredients blend to create a silky sweet chocolate outside and a soft crunch cookie inside for the perfect guilt-free indulgence.
Bullet Point 4: GASTROINTESTINAL FRIENDLY & QUICKLY DIGESTIBLE: Despite being packed with nutrients, our bar is GI-friendly and won't make you gassy like most protein bars on the market. Rich in whey protein isolate, this snack supports fast digestion and ensures gastrointestinal ease. Perfect for the active individual, it offers efficient energy and assists in recuperation while maintaining GI well-being.
Bullet Point 5: POST-WORKOUT SNACK FOR OPTIMAL RECOVERY: Packed with 20g of whey protein isolate, we promote optimal recuperation post-workout when your muscles seek fast-digesting protein. The fast digestion of whey isolate aids in rapid muscle repair and growth. Its easy digestion enhances bioavailability, optimizing protein absorption while maintaining GI (gastrointestinal) well-being. Indulge in this stomach-friendly treat for a rapid and efficient post-workout protein uplift.
Product Description: 20 Grams Of High-Quality Protein Incredible Taste And Texture GI Friendly And Won't Bog You Down Extremely Satisfying (actually curbs appetite and cravings) Emphasis On Whey Protein Isolate The Gorilla Bar has arrived! Formerly, the Peanut Butter Bar, which launched in the Summer of 2023, had the goal of providing an incredibly tasty, satisfying bar with high-quality protein that won’t bog you down or upset your stomach. We accomplished those goals and were very happy with the bar, but we recognized there was still room for improvement. All of the significant changes that impact all Gorilla Bar flavors include: Improved Flavors: our first generation bars all used peanut butter as the base nut butter, which is a powerful flavor that masked much of the individual flavor in each bar. In addition to increasing the flavor intensity, we also switched to a cashew butter base for cookies & cream, oatmeal chocolate chip, and cookie dough. We did keep peanut butter for the peanut butter cup flavor of course. Lastly, we optimized the sodium content for maximum flavor. Improved Texture: our first generation bars were firmer than we wanted them to be and become firmer over the course of their shelf life. To improve this, we adjusted the ratio of whey powder to whey crisps, introduced more inclusions such as chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, or cookie pieces, and adjusted the overall protein content slightly to 20 grams per bar. The outcome was a much softer bar with better texture. Improved Melt Point: to help address the potential for the bars melting in hot climates during the summer months we’ve improved the coating used on the bars. This provides a higher melt point. While this doesn’t guarantee they won’t begin to melt in very hot conditions, it does increase the melt point relative to our first generation bars for a better customer experience.

Bullet Point 1: Sweetened with real cane sugar - No Artificial Sweeteners, No Corn Syrup, No Stevia
Bullet Point 2: An alternative to diet sodas - no diet sweetener aftertaste, and half the sugar content of traditional sodas. Enjoy less calories without sacrificing taste!
Bullet Point 3: A crisp and refreshing take on Cola, without the overpowering sticky sweetness found in other Colas.
Product Description: Demi Doux low sugar sodas are made with about half the sugar you’ll find in “regular” sodas. That means the underlying flavors aren’t masked by sweetness; you’ll taste a deep richness of flavor that isn’t possible with highly sweetened sodas. A typical 12-oz can of soda contains over 3 tablespoons of sugar. On average, Americans consume about 77 pounds of sugar each year, more than half of which comes from soft drinks! Demi Doux cuts the sugar in half, making it lower calorie and less filling while still delivering great taste. Because it is less filling, low sugar Demi Doux is great with meals and contributes to a healthier diet. Demi Doux uses only real cane sugar – no corn syrup or artificial sweeteners. That means it’s more thirst quenching than regular or diet sodas, and tastes better than artificially sweetened soft drinks or drinks made with corn syrup.

Bullet Point 3: Manufacturer: TerraVita
Bullet Point 4: Size: 8 oz
Bullet Point 5: Loose Leaf Herbal Tea - Packed in a convenient upright pouch!
Product Description: Very fruity character inspiring memories of juicy, ripe pears. - We only use high grown Ceylon tea from estates more than 5500 feet above sea level; We only use natural flavors, giving a clean true taste with no chemical aftertaste - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil. Place 1 teaspoon of tea for each cup into the teapot. Pour the boiling water into the teapot. Cover and let steep for 3-7 minutes according to taste (the longer the steeping time the stronger the tea). Even though milk and a dash of sugar help enhance the flavor character on this tea, it is perfectly acceptable to consume this tea &quot;straight-up.&quot; - Iced tea brewing method (to make 1 liter/quart): Place 6 teaspoons of tea into a teapot or heat resistant pitcher. Pour 1 1/4 cups of freshly boiled water over the tea. Steep for 5 minutes. Quarter fill a serving pitcher with cold water. Pour the tea into your serving pitcher straining the leaves. Add ice and top-up the pitcher with cold water. Garnish and sweeten to taste. [A rule of thumb when preparing fresh brewed iced tea is to double the strength of hot tea since it will be poured over ice and diluted with cold water]. Please note that this tea may tend to go cloudy or &quot;milky&quot; when poured over ice; a perfectly normal characteristic of some high quality black teas and nothing to worry about! - What type of tea do we use, how do we flavor the tea and why do we use natural flavors? - Firstly...we only use high grown teas from the top 3 tea growing regions of Sri Lanka - Nuwara Eliya, Dimbula and Uva. These three high-grown districts produce flavorful teas that have classic &quot;Ceylon&quot; tea character which is noted by floral bouquet and flavor notes, touches of mild astringency, bright coppery col

Fresh apricots are also a great source of vitamin A. The sweet character of the fruit blends exceptionally with our high grown Ceylon tea and goes well with a dash of sugar. So brew a pot, pour two cups and let the fireworks begin! - We only use high grown Ceylon tea from estates more than 5500 feet above sea level; We only use natural flavors, giving a clean true taste with no chemical aftertaste - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil. Place 1 teaspoon of tea for each cup into the teapot. Pour the boiling water into the teapot. Cover and let steep for 3-7 minutes according to taste (the longer the steeping time the stronger the tea). Even though milk and a dash of sugar help enhance the flavor character on this tea, it is perfectly acceptable to consume this tea &quot;straight-up.&quot; - Iced tea brewing method (to make 1 liter/quart): Place 6 teaspoons of tea into a teapot or heat resistant pitcher. Pour 1 1/4 cups of freshly boiled water over the tea. Steep for 5 minutes. Quarter fill a serving pitcher with cold water. Pour the tea into your serving pitcher straining the leaves.

Bullet Point 1: DESCRIPTION: Each order contains three (3) 12-oz packages of Country Ham, including two center cuts and end pieces per package. The ham is vacuum-packed, shelf-stable with or without refrigeration, and expertly trimmed of excess fat. Thinly sliced for quick preparation, it sears perfectly in a hot, heavy skillet in about one minute per side until it reaches an internal temperature of 155°F. This 3-pack is convenient for both use and storage.
Bullet Point 2: A TASTE FROM ANOTHER PLACE IN TIME: Rays Country Ham is more than just ham—it’s heritage. Crafted with century-old curing methods, our salt-cured, air-dried ham reflects traditions from North Carolina’s Blue Ridge Mountains. Every slice delivers the deep, savory richness of authentic country ham. For over 75 years, Rays has been a Southern favorite, offering an unmistakable flavor that stands the test of time. Taste true Blue Ridge craftsmanship in every bite.
Bullet Point 3: RICH, BOLD FLAVOR – TRADITIONALLY CURED While many products labeled “country ham” may be unexpectedly mild, Ray’s preserves the deep, savory flavor that made Ray Goad’s legendary Country Ham Biscuits famous. Hand-rubbed with a classic blend of salt, pepper, and brown sugar, this Blue Ridge Mountain dry-cured and aged ham delivers the salty, robust taste that Country Ham lovers expect. If you’re seeking a genuinely authentic Country Ham experience, this is the flavor you’ve been craving.
Bullet Point 4: WHO WILL LOVE THIS HAM: Devoted Country Ham lovers who miss that true, salt, and dry-cured taste will feel at home with Rays Country Ham. This ham is for you if you grew up in the Southeast, where Country Ham & Biscuits are a staple at the breakfast table, family picnics, and funerals. It’s also a heartfelt gift of remembered flavors of traditional ham curing. Sharing good food is more than nourishment; it’s how we connect, reflect, and celebrate the ties that bring us together.
Bullet Point 5: FIRST-TIME BUYERS: WHAT TO EXPECT: If you’ve never tried authentic Country Ham, prepare for a bold, salty taste combined with a deep, savory flavor that differs from typical sweet ""city"" hams. If you prefer a milder flavor, soak the slices in a dish of cold water for 10 minutes to reduce the saltiness. However, this ham is for those who appreciate a traditional Southern salt and dry-cured ham, with the robust, savory character that has made Country Ham a beloved favorite for generations.
Bullet Point 6: COOKING & STORAGE (OWNER’S MANUAL INCLUDED): You’ll receive an Owner’s Manual with cooking instructions—helpful soaking tips, quick skillet-frying methods, and optional red-eye gravy recipes. Once opened, wrap and refrigerate or freeze for future meals. This flexible format ensures you can enjoy hearty portions of real Blue Ridge Mountain–cured ham when the craving strikes.
Bullet Point 7: A TIMELESS SOUTHERN TRADITION DELIVERED Ray Goad was the first to serve Country Ham Biscuits for breakfast in a Fast-Food restaurant, continuing a 75-year family tradition of dry-cured, aged country ham from North Carolina’s Blue Ridge Mountains. Now, you can enjoy this bold, old-fashioned flavor at home—a cherished tradition, perfected and conveniently available for those who crave and truly appreciate authentic Country Ham. .

Nowadays the berry is a favorite for making jams, jellies, and wine due to its tart flavor profile. The astringency of the berry also makes it a natural when paired with our high grown Ceylon tea. - We only use high grown Ceylon tea from estates more than 5500 feet above sea level; We only use natural flavors, giving a clean true taste with no chemical aftertaste - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil. Place 1 teaspoon of tea for each cup into the teapot. Pour the boiling water into the teapot. Cover and let steep for 3-7 minutes according to taste (the longer the steeping time the stronger the tea). Even though milk and a dash of sugar help enhance the flavor character on this tea, it is perfectly acceptable to consume this tea &quot;straight-up.&quot; - Iced tea brewing method (to make 1 liter/quart): Place 6 teaspoons of tea into a teapot or heat resistant pitcher. Pour 1 1/4 cups of freshly boiled water over the tea. Steep for 5 minutes. Quarter fill a serving pitcher with cold water. Pour the tea into your serving pitcher straining the leaves.

Bullet Point 5: Revolutionary instant tea extract drink technology: healthy, portable, convenient, and delicious.
Product Description: Tea extract is the newest generation of instant tea beverages. Unlike other tea drinks and tea extracts, LeCharm’s distinct tea extract is both beneficial for a healthy lifestyle and enjoyable to drink. It’s sugar free, contains 0 calories, and contains 0 fats. Every drink of LeCharm’s tea extract beverage is pure flavor and nutrients. Tea extract drinks make instant tea because they’re made purely from natural substances extracted directly from fresh tea leaves. After all those substances are extracted, they’re blended and refined till the LeCharm tea extract is ready to go. There are 0 calories, 0 fats, and no added sugar because those substances aren’t extracted or involved. The tea extract is in the form of a powder that smoothly melts into liquid water at hot or cold temperatures. This tea drink is the height of portability. After getting their crystallized tea powder sachet out, they can create iced tea with some cold water or get the feeling of a freshly brewed pot using hot water. Traditional tea drinks, like loose leaf tea, take equipment and time to create. That sort of preparation is inconvenient for one’s daily life. Tea can’t be made that way while traveling, at work, exercising at the gym, or participating in sport activities. LeCharm’s tea beverage, on the other hand, can be brought to all those environments. As long as water can be obtained or carried, there’s no limit to the places where you can make fresh batches of tea drinks. The tea powder sachets of our crystallized tea extract is small, so there won’t be any problem finding a place to slip them inside. LeCharm is tea on the go, and it can be three seconds away no matter where you are. The tea is instant at every situation: made in a cup while you’re in your car, made in a bottle when you’re out for a run or at the gym, made in the break room or by a water cooler, made on a plane with a cup of water you’ve asked for, or made at a restaurant instead of paying so much for a sugary drink.

Bullet Point 1: DEALCOHOLIZED | Our non-alcoholic Riesling undergoes traditional winemaking and is gently liberated from alcohol.
Bullet Point 2: TASTING NOTES | Bouquet of apples and yellow fruit, noble citrus notes with acidity expected from Rieslings.
Bullet Point 3: PAIRING SUGGESTIONS | Poached lobster with a citrus and herb beurre blanc. The wine's yellow fruit notes and elegant minerality complement the delicate sweetness of the lobster, while its animating freshness balances the richness of the beurre blanc. A side of lightly sautéed asparagus with lemon zest can further enhance the meal, adding a touch of brightness that aligns beautifully with the wine's profile.
Bullet Point 4: ORIGIN, TERROIR & WINE MASTER'S NOTES | This Riesling hails from Germany, produced from vines growing on loamy loess and slate soils. It undergoes temperature-controlled fermentation in stainless steel and matures on the fine lees to enhance its complexity and depth.
Bullet Point 5: KOLONNE NULL | Founded in 2018, we've embarked on a mission to create the finest non-alcoholic wines. Our wine lab works closely with partner winemakers and research institutions to push the limits of what is achievable in fine non-alcoholic wine.
Product Description: Kolonne Null's mission is to create the finest non-alcoholic wines. We are able to accomplish this by respecting traditional craftsmanship while pushing the boundaries to create new innovative flavors and finishing concepts. Since 2018, we have been traveling through the wine world and have built up what is probably the most specialized non-alcoholic wine company in the entire world. Our own wine lab is in continual exchange with our partner winemakers and research institutions to regularly raise the bar of what is achievable. We have evolved from industry newcomers to industry leaders. With the development of our laboratory and various research partnerships, we are becoming better at understanding the key drivers of our business, more accurate, more focused and also more selective in choosing our partners - along the entire value chain from the grapevine to the printed shipping box. What makes Kolonne Null so special is that our aim is to bring the characteristics of the growing region, the grape and the winemakers into the bottle, so that we can transparently tell the story of each wine. Closely linked to the highest standards of quality and perfection for the product and for ourselves. Where the journey is headed? In contrast to 2018, our work now already begins in the vineyard. We discuss with the winemakers even before the harvest how we want to develop the respective wine. However, we believe that the ultimate added value can only be achieved through our own production and the associated representative headquarter. In addition, we are planning a vineyard in Brandenburg's Havelland region, to which the most exciting and at the same time most courageous international winemakers will make a pilgrimage, in order to raise (non-alcoholic) wine to a new level together with Kolonne Null.

1090,201247,"Item Name: Spry On The Go Fresh Natural Xylitol Chewing Gum Dental Defense System - Aspartame-Free, Sugar-Free, Non-GMO (Peppermint, 55 Count - Pack of 2)
Bullet Point 1: ON THE GO PEPPERMINT GUM: Spry peppermint gum will help to keep you breath smelling fresh and is moisturizing for your mouth. It’s the ideal freshen up gum that is also good for your teeth. Our gum is conveniently packed so you can stay fresh on the road, at work, or with your friends. The natural peppermint gives a blast of cool, refreshing flavor, which provides a nice alternative to other aspartame free gum.
Bullet Point 2: IMPROVES TOOTH DENTAL CARE: Clinical studies have shown that the use of xylitol on a daily basis may reduce the risk of tooth decay. Our Spry gum is part of an essential dental defense system that may also help fight off cavities. Xylitol is a natural ingredient that inhibits contaminants' ability to stick to your teeth. When contaminants can't stick, they can't colonize. Ask your dentist and hygienist about the amazing benefits of xylitol.
Bullet Point 3: SUGAR FREE XYLITOL GUM: Instead of corn syrup or sugar our gum is made with 100% xylitol. Xylitol sweetener is derived from the fibrous parts of plants, similar in taste to regular organic sugar. We use no filler, flow agents or other sugar additives. Xylitol is a natural sugar that tastes just like real sugar and a great choice when looking for sweetners and sugar alternatives.
Bullet Point 4: NON-GMO GLUTEN FREE NATURAL GUM: Unlike other packs of gum, Spry gum uses natural ingredients that are Non GMO and gluten free. Spry Xylitol gum is 40% lower in calories than other mint gum that contain regular sugars, but contains the same sweetness. It can be a great choice for using in foods and snacks, keto friendly foods or used in sugar support supplements.
Bullet Point 5: FIGHTS BAD BREATH: Use daily after meals and between normal brushes. For best results use Spry Peppermint Gum with Spry Coolmint Toothpaste and Spry Coolmint Oral Rinse for a fresh breath.Spry Peppermint Chewing Gum can help prevent bad breath caused by a poor pH balance, dry mouth, and the lack of saliva. Chewing xylitol gum after meals can increase your saliva output and help neutralize the acids that cause bad breath.
Product Description: Clinical trials have shown the benefits of chewing gum sweetened with Xylitol after meals and snacks. Xylitol is a five-carbon sugar alcohol that has nearly identical taste and bulk to table sugar (sucrose), but with amazing dental benefits! Not only does it have fewer calories and less effect than sucrose, but it also has the added benefit of inhibiting the creation of acid in the mouth. This minimizes the damage done to your teeth, as well as allows your teeth to heal (remineralize) at a faster rate. Xylitol also has a low glycemic index of 7, compared to sugar’s level of 83. It is recommended that you chew a piece of xylitol gum after every meal or snack for maximum benefit to your teeth as it may reduce the risk of decay in the tooth. Xylitol is recommended by dentists, medical doctors, periodontists, pediatricians, and many health organizations and health professionals worldwide as a sweetener for anyone concerned with dental health, upper respiratory health, and sugar consumption, in general. Products sweetened with xylitol create an unwelcome environment for contaminants; study after study has shown that they simply do not stick well to teeth in a xylitol-rich environment.

Bullet Point 3: Meet Our Founder: In 2006, with two gluten-intolerant children, Mrs. F. Katz was dissatisfied with the lacklustre gluten-free products available in stores. Her children wanted the snacks others were eating, but she needed to be sure they were gluten free, so she began experimenting at home with unique ingredients and baked tasty snacks for her family and friends. Today, the company has grown from a one-woman kitchen bakery to a full, state-of-the-art facility. Gluten free and full of taste!
Bullet Point 4: Allergy Aware Ingredients: Mrs. Katz knew that Katz gluten free products needed to address more than just gluten allergies. At the time, allergies to tree nuts and peanuts were on the rise and finding nut free kid snacks was also not easy. To help as many people as possible dealing with food allergies, Mrs. Katz committed to manufacturing in the United States in her own Certified Gluten, Dairy and Nut-Free (Tree Nuts & Peanuts) Facility. Try our bakery fresh pastries today!
Bullet Point 5: Easy To Prepare: Katz Gluten-Free Toaster Pastries are the perfect treat to satisfy your cravings at any time of the day! Freshly baked and shelf-stable, these pastries are ready to enjoy straight out of the package. However, for an extra touch of warmth and to further enhance the flavors, we recommend using a toaster oven.

Product Description: <br><b>Size : 1 Pound</br></b> <br>Chocolate is delicious. For most, it occupies an exalted position other sweet treats only dream of achieving. It’s surprising to think, then, that all the glorious nuances present in cacao beans—the ingredient that sets chocolate apart from other sugary snacks—are actually quite foreign to our modern palates. The result of this process is chocolate that merely alludes to the flavor most of us crave. With the help of Andy Anand Chocolate that emphasizes, instead of homogenizes, the exquisite flavor of cacao. </br> <br>Amazingly Delicious Belgian Dark Chocolate Covered orange peel is the perfect sweet treat with a burst of orange flavor. Orange peels are boiled in a simple syrup until slightly translucent and then coated with Delicious Dark Belgian Chocolate. The sweet temptations of chocolate-covered snacks are very hard to resist. Taste in every Bite, handmade in small batches, to create that unique taste not found in any mass produced Chocolates.</br> <br>Discover the ultimate indulgence with the best boxed dark chocolate, including rich dark chocolate gift box for an exquisite taste experience.

Bullet Point 1: These chips of sweet cassia bark cinnamon possess a perfect amount of bark and bite.
Bullet Point 2: Cassia bark cinnamon chips are spicy-sweet, rolled, woody pieces of Korintje cinnamon perfect for infusing curry, dessert sauces or a hot drink
Bullet Point 3: All Natural, Gluten-Free, Kosher Parve, Non-GMO
Product Description: Cassia is simply the bark of a laurel tree, a tropical evergreen. Nearly the same as cinnamon, it is sometimes called Chinese Cinnamon. The two spices can be used interchangeably. Cassia is a bit coarser and the taste is not quite as delicate. In all appearances, cassia looks and nearly smells the same as cinnamon. Not quite as sweet as cinnamon, it is used more in savory dishes in China. Cassia bark is perfect for use when making homemade chai tea blends, pickling spice blends, or if you’re brewing your own spirits. In addition, we love to keep these cassia chips on hand for the spice grinder to add to coffee and tea, or to toss into curries or masalas. During winter, take a small spoonful and drop them into simmering pots of cider and wine you plan to mull through the afternoon before a big holiday party. Since we use Korintje cinnamon you get a rounded, sweet cinnamon flavor with a mild bite that won’t overpower your recipe. Use cassia spice in the same manner as Cinnamon.

Bullet Point 1: GRAIN FREE GOODNESS: Cassava is a complex carb that naturally contains vitamins (like vitamin c) & antioxidants (including phenolic compounds), high in resistant starch and fiber so it can promote gut health. The cassava flour that we use is not only organic, but it is also Fair Trade Certified, gluten-free certified, non-allergenic, nut and grain free, non-gmo and Kosher certified.
Bullet Point 2: WHEN CAN I GIVE MY KID PUFFS? Babies and toddlers can start eating puffs when they can sit independently, use pincer grasp to self feed, crawl with their stomach off the ground, or use their jaws to mash food between gums, typically around 7 months and up. Our puffs begin to dissolve when they interact with saliva, so no teeth are needed to eat them. However, with all foods, we recommend that a child not be left unattended while feeding.
Bullet Point 3: PERFECT SAVORY BLENDS: Our puffs are savory and help introduce vegetable flavors that are sometimes pushed away at the dinner table. Parents can feel good about feeding these to their little ones because the puffs have ZERO grams of sugar and no nutrient poor ingredients like rice or wheat. It is crucial to introduce savory flavors during a baby’s flavor window.
Bullet Point 4: ETHICALLY SOURCED: Our 100% USDA Organic Cassava Flour is World Fair Trade Organization Certified and comes from over 1,100 farms in Nicaragua. Fair Trade Certified means that the product is made in compliance with the 10 Principles of Fair Trade which covers human and labour rights. In doing so, we are able to help create opportunities for entrepreneurs to build their businesses, children to go to school, farmers to feed their communities, and families to end the cycle of generational poverty.
Bullet Point 5: CERTIFIED GLUTEN FREE: Our Grain Free Puffs are made with gluten-free ingredients and certified gluten free by the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO). The GFCO is an independent third party certifying agency who reviews ingredients and manufacturing facilities to ensure they are compliant with gluten-free standards.
Bullet Point 6: OLIVE OIL FOR HEALTHY FATS: Vegetarian and vegan-friendly certified organic olive oil is a great source of healthy monounsaturated fats and antioxidants. Little ones need fat because they have high energy needs, but little room in their tummies. Fat is energy and that energy is needed! Fat also helps little bodies absorb the nutrients needed to make brain development and growth happen.

Because the cocoa butter is out of the picture, you will not have to temper this product in order to achieve shine, snap, and a smooth mouth feel. When using candy wafers, it is required that you melt the wafers completely, and chill the finished product to ensure proper set up. It is important that a few precautions are taken throughout the process. Once you understand the procedure, it might be hard to see the benefits of attempting to work with “real” chocolate in your home.<br><br><b>Candy Wafers vs. Real Chocolate</b><br>Candy wafers are not actually chocolate. In the culinary world, they are also known as compound coating or confectionery coating. They are similar to chocolate but have a few differences, which make them easier to work with. For example, have you ever tried to melt chocolate chips or chocolate bars, and ended up with a fudge-like mass that is too thick for drizzling, fondue, or painting inside a candy mold? Or even worse, had the finished piece look white-ish gray and streaky after it set-up? Candy wafers not only have easier workability and comparable flavor to other chocolate products on the market, but the finished product looks professional every time.<br><br><br><br>Contains milk and soy. May contain trace amounts of peanuts due to common processing equipment.

The flax seed is a well-rounded source of essential nutrients that keeps the body functioning at optimum health and assists in developing a strong immune system. We recommend grinding before eating for maximum nutrient absorption. It is best to grind your own flax seeds, rather than buying pre-ground flax seed meal, as their rich supply of healthy omega fats start to oxidize and degrade immediately after grinding. Grinding your own flax seeds ensures you’re maximizing the amazing health benefits of this powerful superfood!

Bullet Point 1: THE MOST EFFICACIOUS ENERGY DRINK (Over 2000 mg of Nootropics) - Most energy drinks provide nothing more than a jolt of caffeine and a smattering of antioxidants. This approach didn’t address the growing demand for true cognitive support and left much to be desired. Gorilla Mind Energy features an incomparable active ingredient profile designed not only to deliver CNS stimulation but also to push the dopaminergic, serotonergic and cholinergic pathways harder than any energy drink has to date.
Bullet Point 2: COMPLETELY UNIQUE & POTENT ACTIVE INGREDIENT PROFILE - Our ‘Energy Matrix’ produces a distinct amplified focus, unmatched energy, elevated mental clarity, and clearly feels more potent than other energy drinks on the market. Gorilla Mind Energy is the perfect synergy of taste and efficacy.
Bullet Point 3: 19 DELICIOUS FLAVORS - Equally as disappointing as the outdated formulations in this industry is the taste of the typical ‘go to’ energy drink. Consumer palates have become far more refined over the past decade, and the bar has been raised for what will stand out in this absurdly saturated market. This is where we take it home. We are VERY confident when we say that all of our flavors will hang with, or beat, any of the big boys in this industry while providing a far more effective formula.
Bullet Point 4: NO SUGAR OR ARTIFICIAL COLORS - Every single one of our energy drink flavors is sugar-free, does not feature any artificial colors, and is as close to calorie-free as possible.

Our spry gum is part of an essential dental defense system that may also help fight off cavities. Xylitol is a natural ingredient that inhibits contaminants' ability to stick to your teeth. When contaminants can't stick, they can't colonize. Ask your dentist and hygienist about the amazing benefits of xylitol.
Bullet Point 3: SUGAR FREE XYLITOL GUM: Instead of corn syrup or sugar our gum is made with 100% xylitol. Xylitol sweetener is derived from the fibrous parts of plants, similar in taste to regular organic sugar. We use no filler, flow agents or other sugar additives. Xylitol is a natural sugar that tastes just like real sugar and a great choice when looking for sweetners and sugar alternatives.
Bullet Point 4: NON-GMO GLUTEN FREE NATURAL GUM: Unlike other packs of gum, Spry gum uses natural ingredients that are Non GMO and gluten free. Spry Xylitol gum is 40% lower in calories than other mint gum that contain regular sugars, but contains the same sweetness. It can be a great choice for using in diabetic foods and snacks, keto friendly foods or used in blood sugar support supplements.
Bullet Point 5: FIGHTS BAD BREATH: Use daily after meals and between normal brushes. For best results use Spry Cinnamon Gum with Spry Coolmint Toothpaste and Spry Coolmint Oral Rinse for a fresh breath. Spry Cinnamon Chewing Gum can help prevent bad breath caused by a poor pH balance, dry mouth, and the lack of saliva. Chewing xylitol gum after meals can increase your saliva output and help neutralize the acids that cause bad breath.
